= `Vagrantfile` for ops-class.org

This creates a development environment containing the OS/161 toolchain that
you can use to complete the https://www.ops-class.org[`ops-class.org`]
programming assignments. Vagrant is a good option for Mac and Windows users.
If you already have Ubuntu installed, you can
https://launchpad.net/~geoffrey-challen/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain[add
our PPA] and install the
toolchain natively using `apt-get`.

== Installation

. (On Windows) Download https://git-scm.com/download/[Git for Windows]. This includes a `bash` shell which you should use in liue of the terrible Windows shell.
. (Required) If you already have https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] installed, upgrade to the latest version.
. (Required) https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/[Install Vagrant]
. (Required) Install two Vagrant plugins:
.. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`. This ensure that your VirtualBox
Guest Additions are up to date.
.. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-timezone`. This synchronizes time between
your VM guest and host.

== Usage and Configuration

Then just `vagrant up`. The default user and hostname is `trinity@zion`. The
OS/161 toolchain is installed from the
https://launchpad.net/~geoffrey-challen/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain[OS/161
toolchain PPA]. Git is also preinstalled.

The default machine configuration is fairly lightweight: you may want to beef
it up a bit. Or not. `sys161` is pretty lightweight itself.

Finally, this Git repository is set up to ignore everything by default, to
support a common case where students place their source directory alongside
the `Vagrantfile`. The `src` subdirectory of this directory is shared with the
virtual machine by default, mounted in the VM as `/home/trinity/src`.

== Known Problems and Workarounds for Windows

=== Missing `MSVCR100.dll`
If your `vagrant up` failed with empty error message like:

image::http://i.imgur.com/75IcjsN.png[GitHub mascot]

It's probably because your Windows OS is missing the `MSVCR100.dll` file.

*Solution:*

1. Download `MSVCR100.dll` from http://fix4dll.com/msvcr100_dll based on your OS.

1. Copy downloaded `MSVCR100.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32\` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` based on your System version 32-bit/64-bit.

=== SSH Connection Issues in Windows Command Prompt

*Symptom:* `vagrant ssh` hangs while connecting.

*Solution:* Vagrant cannot connect over ssh using Windows Command Prompt.  Please use Git Bash or Cygwin instead.


=== Windows Virtualization Issues

*Symptom:*  `vagrant up` Hangs While Connecting

*Solution:*

1. Make sure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS.

2. If Hyper-V is enabled, disable it. Vagrant cannot coexist with Hyper-V.

=== `bmake` fails with symbolic link errors

*Symptom:* `ln: failed to create symbolic link ...`

*Solution:* Windows requires users to have special privileges for creating symbolic links.
